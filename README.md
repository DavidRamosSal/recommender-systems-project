# Recommender systems project

Requires uv and Python 3.12. If uv is not installed, follow the
[uv installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
Run commands from the repository root.

Reproduce every number, table and generated figure in the current Part 1 report:

```bash
uv run --locked scripts/run_all.py --data-dir data/ml-1m
```

This installs the dependencies pinned in `uv.lock`, downloads MovieLens 1M if the
default dataset is missing, and generates the data analysis, 60-setting validation
search, all nine baseline results, and figures.

Final results are saved to `results/results.csv`, figures to `results/images/`,
and supporting report tables to `results/intermediate/`.

For an existing dataset, pass `--data-dir /path/to/ml-1m`, pointing to the folder
containing `ratings.dat`, `movies.dat` and `users.dat`. Use `--out-dir /path/to/results`
to change the output directory.

The [project report](report/Recommender_Systems_Report.pdf) ([Word version](report/Recommender_Systems_Report.docx)) and [results spreadsheet](results/Recommender_Systems_Results.xlsm) are included in this repository.
